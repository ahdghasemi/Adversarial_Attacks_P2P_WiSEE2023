# Adversarial Attacks on Resource Management in P2P Wireless Communications

## Abstract

This paper explores adversarial attacks on a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based radio resource management in point-to-point (P2P) communications (Our new paper! Will be uploaded soon!). Specifically, we examine the vulnerability of the trained GNN model, which processes information from transceiver pairs, during the test phase. A novel adversarial attack is introduced which adeptly modifies the vertices of the GNN model while adhering to various constraints. The attack’s effectiveness is measured against metrics like the number of users and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore, the proposed attack articulates optimization problems with the intention of minimizing system communication quality, encapsulating specific constraints.

## Conclusion

The paper navigates through the complex waters of adversarial attacks on centralized GNN-based peer-to-peer communication, introducing a novel adversarial attack named Bc vertex perturbation. Thorough evaluation spotlighting its consequential impact on the Quality of Communication (QoC) has been conducted. Remarkably, the Bc edge perturbation leads to a reduction of QoC by up to 35%, demonstrating higher efficacy as the user count surges. Furthermore, when RXs are variably distanced from their respective TXs, the Bc vertex perturbation inflicts additional damage on the total QoC. Intriguingly, SNR values do not influence the attack’s performance, underscoring a critical need for the establishment of defensive mechanisms against such adversarial attacks and illuminating the pivotal role of research centered on the security and robustness of deep learning-oriented wireless systems.
